***Analyze A/B Test Results***
Understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

***Testing a Perceptual Phenomenon - Analyzing the Stroop Effect***
The Stroop test is used to examine interference on reading ability. Researchers use this test and the Trail Making Test for measuring cognitive dysfunction. In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
