Exploratory Data Analysis

Conclusions

     \#\# Introduction

For this project I will be investigating the IMDB Dataset. This dataset
contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie
Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

\hypertarget{dataset-column-descriptions}{%
\subsubsection{Dataset Column
Descriptions}\label{dataset-column-descriptions}}

Popularity: Popularity is based on user interactions on the IMDB data
website. It is calculated based on things like page views, users adding
it to a list, users rating it, etc. Release date also plays a part with
recently released shows weighted higher in popularity.

Budget: The budget is the amount of money in American Dollars (USD)
spent to make the movie.

Budget Inflation Adjusted: The inflation adjusted budget is the amount
of money in American Dollars (USD) spent to make the movie adjusted for
inflation since the movie was released.

Revenue: The revenue is the amount of money in American Dollars (USD)
that a movie earned.

Revenue Inflation Adjusted: The inflation adjusted revenue is the amount
of money in American Dollars (USD) earned by a movie adjusted for
inflation since the movie was released.

Original Title: The original title is the title used in the original
version of the film.

Cast: The cast of the original (not dubbed or extended) version.

Homepage: The movie homepages are now supported for all translations
with only official links allowed. When there is no official website
(e.g.~https://itthemovie.com), the producer or main distributor's
website is allowed.

Director: Director of the movie.

Tagline: A movie tagline is usually a short promotional text used on the
poster.

Overview: Overviews should be to the point, spoiler-free and brief. A
few lines at most. No (actor name) or technical info.

Keywords: A keyword is a word (or group of connected words) attached to
a title (movie / TV series / TV episode) to describe any notable object,
concept, style or action that takes place during a title. The main
purpose of keywords is to allow visitors to easily search and discover
titles.

Genres: The list of official genres for movies.

Production Companies: List of companies that produced the movie.

Release Year: Year of original release.

Release Date: Date of original release.

Runtime: The runtime of the original release of the movie.

Vote Count: Number of votes for a movie.

Vote Weighted Average: All the registered members of IMDb can cast their
votes/ratings for any movie. IMDb takes all the individual votes cast by
the registered users and uses them to calculate a single rating. The
rating displayed on a movie's page is a weighted average rating. Though
some of the websites claim that they know how weighted average of IMDb
works, IMDb itself has never given out the method that they use for the
fear of it being manipulated. They state on their website that they use
the same method for all the movies without any bias so that the ratings
are fair.

 \#\#\# Questions for Analysis

Which genres are most popular from year to year?

Which genres have the highest vote average month to month?

Which keywords have the highest vote average?

What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have women
directors?

     \#\# Data Wrangling Summary

In this section we will:

Load the data and begin data wrangling.

Check for cleanliness by running statistics.

Summarize dataset cleaning operations to be performed.

Perform data cleaning.

Verify cleanliness by re-running statistics.

Perform necessary field data wrangling.

     \#\#\# Load the data and begin data wrangling

Load the tmdb-movies dataset.

Convert the date column from string to date type.

Add a month column to enable analysis by month as well as year.

Drop the budget and revenue columns in favor of the inflation adjusted
columns.

     \#\#\# Summary of Dataset Cleanliness

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  There is one duplicate row in the dataset that should be removed.
\item
  Several fields have null values. Based on the questions I wanted to
  explore, genres is the one of interest. Below I will remove the 23
  rows where the genres is null which is only .2\% of the rows in the
  dataset.
\item
  The year portion of the release date field is only two digits and
  therefore not meaningful. The release year is captured in another
  field. It is interesting that so many films are released in December
  and January and it may be due to timing time for the awards shows.
  This will be noted in the analysis section below.
\item
  The budget and revenue fields have \textgreater{}50\% values equal to
  zero. Based on areas of analysis and after looking at correlations I
  decided to leave them as is.

     \#\# Conclusions

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Finally, summarize your findings and the results that have
been performed. Make sure that you are clear with regards to the
limitations of your exploration. If you haven't done any statistical
tests, do not imply any statistical conclusions. And make sure you avoid
implying causation from correlation!
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Once you are satisfied with your work, you should save a
copy of the report in HTML or PDF form via the \textbf{File}
\textgreater{} \textbf{Download as} submenu. Before exporting your
report, check over it to make sure that the flow of the report is
complete. You should probably remove all of the ``Tip'' quotes like this
one so that the presentation is as tidy as possible. Congratulations!
