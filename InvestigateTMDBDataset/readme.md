# Overview

Exploratory Analysis of The Movie Database (TMDb)dataset. The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies including user ratings and revenue.  I explored four questions:

* Which genres are most popular from year to year?
* Which genres have the highest vote average each month?
* Which keywords are most frequent by decade?
* What properties are associated with movies that have women directors?
