# Overview

The Stroop Color and Word Test is used to examine interference on reading ability. According to this article https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/stroop-sb.html, researchers use this test and the Trail Making Test for measuring cognitive dysfunction. Results are impacted by motor speech problems, reading skill level, english as a second language, and injuries to the brain.

The project analyzed the data using descriptive statistics, measured central tendency and variability.  I assume the there is no difference between the mean response time for incongruent and congruent word lists. Type I error rate of 5%.

_The null hypothesis: The difference between mean response times for congruent and incongruent word lists are the same._<br>
_The alternative hypothesis: The difference between mean times for congruent and incongruent word lists are different._<br>
